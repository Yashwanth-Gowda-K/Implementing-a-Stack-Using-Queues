# Implementing-a-Stack-Using-Queues


Problem Overview
This solution demonstrates how to implement a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack using only First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queues. The challenge requires simulating all standard stack operations (push, pop, top, and empty) while adhering to queue principles.

Key Insight
The fundamental challenge lies in overcoming the inherent behavioral difference between stacks and queues:
Stacks remove the most recently added item (LIFO)
Queues remove the least recently added item (FIFO)
Our solution bridges this gap using a two-queue approach that strategically reorganizes elements when needed.

Implementation Strategy
We maintain two queues:
Main Queue: Holds elements in insertion order
Temp Queue: Assists in element reorganization

Operation Breakdown:
Push (O(1) time):
Simply enqueues to the main queue
Preserves natural insertion order
Pop/Top (O(n) time):
Transfers all elements except the last one to the temp queue
Accesses/removes the last element (simulating stack behavior)
Restores remaining elements to the main queue
Empty (O(1) time):
Checks if the main queue contains any elements

Performance Characteristics
Operation	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
push()	O(1)	O(1)
pop()	O(n)	O(1)
top()	O(n)	O(1)
empty()	O(1)	O(1)
